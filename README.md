# Git workflow diagram

A basic git workflow diagram to quickly consult if you are having doubts about on what to do with your git mess. Also, I strong recommend you to use some GUI, for general purposes [git-gui](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-gui) is more than enough.

[Shout out for git-sim, where you can simulate Git operation before doing it](https://initialcommit.com/blog/git-sim).
